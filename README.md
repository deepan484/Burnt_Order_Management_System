# 🌟 Gen AI-Based Order Management System 🌟  

> **Transforming natural language into actionable structured orders!**  

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a cutting-edge **Gen AI-based order management system** that uses conversational AI and vector databases to streamline order processing. From interpreting natural language to generating precise orders, the system is designed to handle the complexities of modern grocery orders with finesse.  

✨ **Key Highlights**:  
- Parse natural language into structured data using **LLM (LLaMA)**.  
- Match products with a vector database powered by **Pinecone**.  
- Generate polished, structured orders with detailed line items.  
- Intuitive user interface for seamless order review and confirmation.  

---

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Conversational Parsing**: Extract items, quantities, and units from user input.  
- **Intelligent Matching**: Use embeddings to find the closest product matches in a database.  
- **Order Generation**: Create structured orders with:  
  - 🆔 **Order ID**  
  - 📅 **Order Date**  
  - 📦 **Line Items**: Product Code, Description, Quantity, and Price.  
- **Interactive Review**:  
  - Adjust quantities.  
  - View similar product alternatives (Upcoming - Feature)  
  - Confirm and finalize the order.

## 🛤️ Architecture and Workflow  

### 1️⃣ **Input Handling**  
Users enter conversational purchase requests into a simple and intuitive text area. For example:  
> "I need 2 bags of 1kg rice and 1 bottle of 500ml olive oil."

---

### 2️⃣ **Text Parsing**  
Using **LLaMA**, the input is processed to extract structured data:  
- **Product Name**: "rice"  
- **Quantity**: "2"  
- **Unit**: "1kg"  

The parsed results are formatted as:  
`[Item Name and Size/Unit]: [Quantity]`  

---

### 3️⃣ **Embedding and Matching**  
- The **BAAI/bge-large-en** model converts extracted item names into embeddings (vector representations).  
- These embeddings are queried against a **Pinecone** index to find the most similar product matches.  
- The matched products include:  
  - Product Code  
  - Description  
  - Price  
---

### 4️⃣ **Order Generation**  
The system assembles the matched products into a structured order, which includes:  
- **Product-Description**: Generated from the matched embedding's Product Code.  
- **quantity**: Fetched dynamically from user's - input via llama.
  
---

### 5️⃣ **Interactive Review**  
Users are presented with an order summary for review:  
- Modify quantities using increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons.  
- View alternative products for each item (Working on that feature)  
- Confirm the order when satisfied.
  
---

### 6️⃣ **Order Finalization**  
Once confirmed, the system generates an **Order Summary** with:  
- Total Price  
- Detailed Line Items  
- Clear Formatting

### 7️⃣ **Downloading Pdf**:
User can have a copy of the final Order:
- Locally have a copy of the order

## 🚀 How to Run  

### Prerequisites  
1. **Install Python**: Version 3.9 or higher.
2. Clone the Repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepan484/Burnt_Order_Management_System.git
cd Burnt_Order_Management_System
```
3.Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
```
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv  

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate  

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. Install Dependencies:
 ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### 🔑 Set Up API Keys  

To run the application, you need to set up API keys for **Pinecone** and **Hugging Face**. Follow these steps:  

### 1. **Pinecone API Key**  
- Go to [Pinecone's official website](https://www.pinecone.io/).  
- Sign up or log in to your account.  
- Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the dashboard.  
- Copy your API key.  

### 2. **Hugging Face API Key**  
- Go to [Hugging Face's official website](https://huggingface.co/).  
- Sign up or log in to your account.  
- Navigate to your **Account Settings** > **Access Tokens**.  
- Generate a new token (select the "Write" scope).  
- Copy the token.  

---

### 3. **Store API Keys in an `.env` File**  
For security, store your API keys in a `.env` file instead of hardcoding them into your application.  

1. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.  
2. Add the following lines, replacing `YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY` and `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` with your actual keys:  

   ```env
   PINECONE_API_KEY=YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
  

### 🏃 Running the Application  
After setting up the environment and API keys:  

1. Start the Flask application by running:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
